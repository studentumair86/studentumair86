Hope you are doing well. It's Muhammad Umair, student of Electrical Engg. It's matter of great pleasure for me to write this email to you. Actually, during my study, I found your great work on Maritime Anomaly detection on AIS data using RNN technique. Your work on the Anomaly using RNN make my wish to reproduce your results for learning and educating myself.
Fortunately, you allowed anyone to use your code. However, since I am not expert of python language, I found difficulties in understanding your code and need assistance.
Could you please help me understand different segments of your code by providing further details.
